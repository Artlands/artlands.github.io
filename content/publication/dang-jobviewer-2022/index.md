abstract: Visualization aims to strengthen data exploration and analysis, especially
  for complex and high-dimensional data. High-performance computing (HPC) systems
  are typically large and complicated instruments that generate massive performance
  and operation time series. Monitoring HPC systems’ performance is a daunting task
  for HPC admins and researchers due to their dynamic natures. This work proposes
  a visual design using the bipartite graph’s idea to visualize HPC clusters’ structure,
  metrics, and job scheduling data. We built a web-based prototype, called JobViewer,
  that integrates advanced methods in visualization and human-computer interaction
  (HCI) to demonstrate the benefits of visualization in real-time monitoring HPC centers.
  We also showed real use cases and a user study to validate the efficiency and highlight
  the current approach’s drawbacks.
