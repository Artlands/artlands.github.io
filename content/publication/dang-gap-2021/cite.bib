 abstract = {Visualizing and monitoring high-performance computing centers is a daunting task due to the systems' complex and dynamic nature. Moreover, different users may have different requirements and needs. For example, computer scientists carry out data analysis as batch jobs using various models, configurations, and parameters, and they often need to manage jobs. System administrators need to monitor and manage the system constantly. In this paper, we discuss the gap between visual monitoring research and practical applicability. We will start with the general requirements for managing high-performance computing centers and then share the experiences working with academic and industrial experts in this domain.},
