abstract: Visualizing and monitoring high-performance computing centers is a daunting
  task due to the systems' complex and dynamic nature. Moreover, different users may
  have different requirements and needs. For example, computer scientists carry out
  data analysis as batch jobs using various models, configurations, and parameters,
  and they often need to manage jobs. System administrators need to monitor and manage
  the system constantly. In this paper, we discuss the gap between visual monitoring
  research and practical applicability. We will start with the general requirements
  for managing high-performance computing centers and then share the experiences working
  with academic and industrial experts in this domain.
