abstract: 'Detecting outliers is one of the fundamental tasks in visual analytics
  and valuable in many application domains, such as suspicious network cyberattack
  recognition. This paper introduces an approach to analyzing and visualizing high-dimensional
  time series, focusing on identifying multivariate observations that are significantly
  different from the others. We also propose a prototype, called MTSAD, to guide users
  when interactively exploring abnormalities in large time series. The prototype contains
  two views: the main window provides an overview of identified outliers overtime,
  the detail window investigates and explores the ranked temporal data entries based
  on their outlying contributions to the overall plots. The visual interface supports
  a full range of interactions, such as lensing, brushing and linking, ranking, and
  filtering. To validate the benefits and usefulness of our approach, we demonstrate
  MTSAD on real-world datasets of different numbers of attributes.'
