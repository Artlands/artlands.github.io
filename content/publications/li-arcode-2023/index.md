abstract: Knowing HPC applications of jobs and analyzing their performance behavior
  play important roles in system management and optimizations. The existing approaches
  detect and identify HPC applications through machine learning models. However, these
  approaches rely heavily on the manually extracted features from resource utilization
  data to achieve high prediction accuracy. In this study, we propose an innovative
  application recognition method, ARcode, which encodes job monitoring data into images
  and leverages the automatic feature learning capability of convolutional neural
  networks to detect and identify applications. Our extensive evaluations based on
  the dataset collected from a large-scale production HPC system show that ARcode
  outperforms the state-of-the-art methodology by up to 18.87% in terms of accuracy
  at high confidence thresholds. For some specific applications (BerkeleyGW and e3sm),
  ARcode outperforms by over 20% at a confidence threshold of 0.8.
