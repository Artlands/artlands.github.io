abstract: This showcase presents a visual approach based on clustering and superimposing
  to construct a high-level overview of sequential event data while balancing the
  amount of information and the cardinality in it. We also implement an interactive
  prototype, called RadarViewer , that allows domain analysts to simultaneously analyze
  sequence clustering, extract useful distribution patterns, drill multiple levels-of-detail
  to accelerate the analysis. The RadarViewer is demonstrated through case studies
  with real-world temporal datasets of different sizes.
