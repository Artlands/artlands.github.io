## üìé Project Summary

Stencil computations play a pivotal role in various high-performance scientific applications, including image processing, fluid dynamics, and solving partial differential equations. However, their performance is often severely constrained by extensive data movements and limited memory bandwidth, commonly referred to as the "Memory Wall." To overcome these limitations, we introduced PIMS, a novel lightweight processing-in-memory (PIM) accelerator specifically designed to enhance the efficiency of stencil computations.

PIMS capitalizes on the logic layer of advanced 3D-stacked memory technologies, notably the Hybrid Memory Cube (HMC), to substantially reduce redundant memory traffic by conducting arithmetic operations directly within the memory. Our innovative approach includes a custom PIMload&add instruction that efficiently manages data-intensive operations, achieving significant performance enhancements with minimal alterations to existing hardware architectures.
