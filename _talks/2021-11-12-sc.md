This work presents cutting-edge visualization, monitoring, and management solutions for HPC systems to understand the status of high-performance computing platforms and provide insight into the interactions among platform components. Benefiting from the greatly increased level of detail available from modern baseboard management controllers through Redfish Telemetry and real-time correlations via API and CLI interfaces to HPC job schedulers, this work provides much greater detail than previous similar projects.
