I am currently a Post-doctoral Researcher in the Department of Computer Science at Texas Tech University, where I also serve as the technical lead for the [Data-Intensive Scalable Computing Laboratory (DISCL)](https://discl.cs.ttu.edu/) and the [NSF Cloud and Autonomic Computing Center (CAC IUCRC)](https://nsfcac.org/).

I earned my Ph.D. in Computer Science from Texas Tech University in May 2024, advising under [Dr. Yong Chen](https://www.myweb.ttu.edu/yonchen/). My research lies at the intersection of `High-Performance Computing (HPC)`, `Systems Security`, and `AI Infrastructure`. I am passionate about addressing critical inefficiencies and security vulnerabilities in modern computing environments through AI-driven system monitoring, proactive cyber-defense, and hardware-software co-design.

My work aims to build secure, autonomous, and energy-efficient architectures capable of powering next-generation scientific discovery and Generative AI workloads. I co-designed and built the [NSF REPACSS cluster (a $12.25M award project)](https://repacss.org/) and developed the `MonSTer` HPC monitoring framework, which has been adopted by [Dell’s Omnia project](https://github.com/dell/omnia).
Previously, I spent three summers as a Graduate Student Intern at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (LBNL), where I worked on data pipelines for telemetry analysis and job scheduling for memory-disaggregated systems.
