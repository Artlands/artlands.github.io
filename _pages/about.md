I am a Ph.D. candidate in Computer Science at Texas Tech University. My advisor is [Dr. Yong Chen](https://www.myweb.ttu.edu/yonchen/) in [Data-Intensive Scalable Computing Laboratory (DISCL)](https://discl.cs.ttu.edu/doku.php?id=home). My current research interests are high-performance computing, computer architecture, parallel and distributed computing. When I'm not sitting at my computer coding, you can find me reading, playing video games, watching comedy, playing sports or hiking.
